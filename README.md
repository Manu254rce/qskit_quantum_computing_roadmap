# Qiskit QC Roadmap ⚛️

This repo contains notes and problems useful for learning Quantum Computing with IBM's Qiskit framework.

## Preamble

Before going through the notes, its vital to have a basic understanding of Quantum Computing with the Qiskit framework.

- [Basics of Quantum Information](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information/)
- [Qiskit Documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/)

***More learning resources can be found at [IBM's Quantum Computing platform](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/)***

### Python and Virtual Environment

Another requirement is to have Python 3 installed and enable a virtual environment set up. (This repository uses a Conda environment that can be automatically set up with the `__init.sh__` file at the root and installs Qiskit along with other dependencies, including Jupyter.)

```bash
./__init__.sh
```

A guide to manually installing Qiskit can be found in the Qiskit documentation [here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html):
